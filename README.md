##### 92nd - Maximum Area in Histogram - think of finding Nearest smallest from left then from right as well

##### 93rd - Maximum Area In Binary Matrix - think of compressing the 2D matrix into 1D, do not buildings need a ground to stand on ;)

##### 98th - Minimum Cost to Merge Stones - Greedy solution done but not optimized :/ ->Need to think differently now

##### 99th - Failed attempt to understand above ques DP solution will look again after sometime with fresh outlook. Sliding window concepts

##### 100th - Sliding Window Maximum - for current element, if this element is greater than back of queue then keep on popping elements. All elements after this should be added to queue

##### 101th - Count of occurence of anagrams - use sliding map, make second string as hashmap, then slide a window and if all characters in hashmap is zero then anangram found else not.

# Challenge completed
# Day counting stopped ,now this would be tracker for all ques i do 

##### Longest substring without Repeating characters - instead of storing each character count better method would be to store index and to check that index lies between left and right pointers 

##### Longest substring with at least k repeating characters - tried 2 methods now trying to understand the sliding window approach, for D&C - take char which are less than k and then partition string based on this. 
- Used sliding window for this here it is - 
first find the total number of unique characters
then loop over the string and find the max substring with only the curr no. of unique characters
and each time update the max variable

##### Subarray with k different integers - find all subarrays with atmost k integers and k-1 integers then subtract them to find our ans
